 *
 *
 * @section Intoduction
 *
 * RapidFit is an XML driven Minuit Fitting tool written in C++ and makes heavy use of inheritance and baseclasses
 *
 *
 * RapidFit is used in multiple Analyses with many PDFs coded up in the pdfs/ folder of the source code
 *
 * RapidFit supports Mutli-Threaded fitting as well as being compiled to run on the Grid as a ROOT library which allows for complex analyses to be reproduced quickly and efficiently
 *
 *
 * @section PDFs
 *
 * PDFs in RapidFit interface with the main codebase by providing methods to Evaluate( DataPoint* ) and Normalise( DataPoint*, PhaseSpace* )
 *
 *
 * @section Scans
 *
 * RapidFit is capable of performing Complex Scans in 1/2 dimension(s) whilst making full use of all of the underlying technology available to a normal fit which makes performing complex scans straight forward
 *
 * @section FeldManCousins
 *
 * RapidFit is capable of performing a complex FeldmanCousins Analysis to act as a cross-check with results which have been produced using simpler scanning code
 *
 * @section GOF
 *
 * @section XML
 *
 * RapidFit is capable of producing XML templates for various reasons as well as having it's own simple XML interpretor for portability and quick features
 *
 *
 * @section Usage
 *
 *
 *
 * For More information See the Source Code
